#### About
Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Ulas. I live in Istanbul, Turkey.

I am a freelance security researcher. I am interested in application security, blockchain security, and web3 security.

Previously, Iâ€™ve worked as an application security engineer at [RootstockLabs](https://www.rootstocklabs.com), [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com), and [Turkish Airlines](https://turkishairlines.com).
